# irctc-railway-reservationsystem
This project presents the development of a Railway Reservation System using Java, aimed at providing a user-friendly and efficient platform for booking train tickets. The system employs object-oriented programming principles and database management techniques to facilitate seamless reservation processes.
Key functionalities include user authentication, train schedule management, seat availability checking, ticket booking, and cancellation features. The system also incorporates error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Through the implementation of Java technologies, this project aims to demonstrate the practical application of programming concepts in real-world scenarios, particularly in the domain of railway ticket reservation. The project serves as a valuable learning experience for students, offering insights into software development methodologies, problem-solving techniques, and collaborative teamwork.
